struct oscar\+::\+Transport\+Meta$<$ Transport $>$}

A struct required by C++, so {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classoscar_1_1Transport}{Transport}}}\textquotesingle{}s subclass can define essentials ahead of instantiating base class. 

Each specialization must include\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Associated type {\ttfamily Address}. It is assumed to be suitable for value semantic.
\item Compile-\/time constant {\ttfamily std\+::size\+\_\+t} expression {\ttfamily BUFFER\+\_\+\+SIZE}, the maximum length of serialized tx message. Sender\textquotesingle{}s message length is bounded by this so transport do not need to provide dynamic allocated buffer. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
