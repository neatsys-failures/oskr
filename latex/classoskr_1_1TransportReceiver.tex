\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\subsubsection*{template$<$Transport\+Trait Transport$>$\newline
class oskr\+::\+Transport\+Receiver$<$ Transport $>$}

The base class for packet-\/listeners, i.\+e., all participants of protocols. The receiving half of the actor model. 

Each instance of {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classoskr_1_1TransportReceiver}{Transport\+Receiver}}} has a static address throughout its lifetime. It also can only work with one specific {\ttfamily Transport} type.

After registered to a {\ttfamily Transport} instance, virtual method {\ttfamily receive\+Message} will be called whenever messages arrives receiver\textquotesingle{}s address.

The {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classoskr_1_1TransportReceiver}{Transport\+Receiver}}} itself does not make any assumption on how to process received message, but a subclass will probably want to call {\ttfamily Transport} methods to send message and schedule timeout. So it is conventional to ask for a reference of {\ttfamily Transport} instance when constructing subclass. Because the {\ttfamily Transport} base class follows CRTP, {\ttfamily Transport \&} is basically equals to {\ttfamily oskr\+::\+Transport$<$Transport$>$ \&} in every situation.
