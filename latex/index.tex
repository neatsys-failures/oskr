\doxysubsection*{High Performance Distributed Protocols Collection}

    

{\bfseries{Motivation.}} This is an attempt to improve based on \href{https://github.com/UWSysLab/specpaxos}{\texttt{ specpaxos}}. The detail of consideration is listed in \href{https://sgdxbc.github.io/ideas/2021-12-15/p0}{\texttt{ a piece of blog}}.

{\bfseries{Why named Oscar?}} Because the core of this project is based on a specialized actor model.

{\bfseries{Present issues\+:}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Heavily-\/used template programming causing terrible error reporting.
\item Heavily-\/used template programming + self-\/contained header result in long compilation time. Because most class in header are templated, precompiled header not help much.
\item Serialization leverage Bitsery, which is a little bit lack of document.
\item Some part of interface has cumbersome syntax, because of required {\ttfamily typename} and such.
\item CMake makes me feel good, meson makes me feel better, but at the end of the day I have to use CMake because of the supportness of most dependencies. This causes the setup of DPDK a little bit hacky and maybe fragile.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Develop on Ubuntu 21.\+10, with clang version 13. Required apt packages\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily cmake}
\item {\ttfamily clang}
\item {\ttfamily clang-\/tidy}
\item {\ttfamily meson}
\item {\ttfamily ninja-\/build}
\item {\ttfamily python3-\/pyelftools}
\item {\ttfamily libboost-\/dev}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Step 1, clone the repo with {\ttfamily -\/-\/recursive}.

Step 2, build CMake project as usual. Initial configuration will build a DPDK, which takes some time. Notable targets\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Client} benchmark client, executable at {\ttfamily $<$build$>$/benchmark/\+Client}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\itshape Work in progress.}

Project structure\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily core}\mbox{[}$^\wedge$1\mbox{]} classes designed to be inherited, and something essential to those classes.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{Foundation_8hpp_source}{Foundation.\+hpp}}} an all-\/in-\/one header for protocol implementation.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily common}\mbox{[}$^\wedge$1\mbox{]} classes designed to be composed.
\item {\ttfamily app}\mbox{[}$^\wedge$1\mbox{]} builtin applications to be supported by protocols.
\item {\ttfamily transport}\mbox{[}$^\wedge$1\mbox{]} runtime implementations that support protocols.
\item {\ttfamily replication} replication protocols.
\item {\ttfamily transactional} transactional protocols.
\item {\ttfamily dependency} git submodule stubs.
\item {\ttfamily test} flat directory for tests.
\end{DoxyItemize}
