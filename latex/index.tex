\doxysubsection*{High Performance Distributed Protocols Collection}

    

{\bfseries{Motivation.}} This is an attempt to improve based on \href{https://github.com/UWSysLab/specpaxos}{\texttt{ specpaxos}}. The detail of consideration is listed in \href{https://sgdxbc.github.io/ideas/2021-12-15/p0}{\texttt{ a piece of blog}}.

{\bfseries{Why named Oskr?}} The name is derived from the Oscars (Academy Awards), because the core of this project is based on a specialized actor model.

{\bfseries{Present issues\+:}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Heavily-\/used template programming + self-\/contained header result in terrible error reporting long compilation time. Because most class in header are templated, precompiled header not help much.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Template programming also make interface more cumbersome with {\ttfamily typename} and such.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Serialization leverage Bitsery, which is a little bit lack of document.
\item CMake makes me feel good, meson makes me feel better, but at the end of the day I have to use CMake because of the supportness of most dependencies. This causes the setup of DPDK a little bit hacky and maybe fragile.
\item The {\itshape executors} draft is not standardized yet. Once it is done, certain part of the project (i.\+e. {\ttfamily Transport}) may be invalidated by it\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For non-\/\+DPDK {\ttfamily Transport}, standard may provide a better alternative but the migration could be hard.
\item Althrough standard or anyone else probably will not provide DPDK {\ttfamily Transport}s, its non-\/standard shape may impede other projects to adapt it.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{Roadmap\+:}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Architecture design + Viewstamped Replication
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} PBFT
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Hot\+Stuff
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Two-\/phase commit
\end{DoxyItemize}

Develop on Ubuntu 21.\+10, with Clang version 13. Required apt packages\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{clang cmake pkg-\/config meson ninja-\/build python3-\/pyelftools libboost-\/dev clang-\/tidy}

\end{DoxyCode}


Step 1, clone the repo with {\ttfamily -\/-\/recursive}.

Step 2, build CMake project as usual. Initial configuration will build a DPDK, which takes some time. Notable targets\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Client} benchmark client, executable at {\ttfamily $<$build$>$/benchmark/\+Client}.
\item {\ttfamily Test$\ast$} unit tests (to get full list run {\ttfamily make help $\vert$ grep Test}), executable at {\ttfamily $<$build$>$/test/\+Test$\ast$}
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\itshape Work in progress.}

Project structure\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily core}\mbox{[}$^\wedge$1\mbox{]} behavioral definition of abstraction components. Pure interfaces without concrete logic.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{Foundation_8hpp_source}{Foundation.\+hpp}}} an all-\/in-\/one header for protocol implementation.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily common}\mbox{[}$^\wedge$1\mbox{]} common behavior logic prepared for reusing.
\item {\ttfamily app}\mbox{[}$^\wedge$1\mbox{]} builtin applications to be supported by protocols.
\item {\ttfamily transport}\mbox{[}$^\wedge$1\mbox{]} runtime implementations that support protocols.
\item {\ttfamily replication} replication protocols.
\item {\ttfamily transactional} transactional protocols.
\item {\ttfamily dependency} git submodule stubs.
\item {\ttfamily test} flat directory for tests.
\item {\ttfamily benchmark} universal entry executable for running all protocols.
\end{DoxyItemize}
